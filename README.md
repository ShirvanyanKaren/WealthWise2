## Code Highlights

Code snippet of data being seeded using fakerJs.

```javascript
const { faker } = require("@faker-js/faker");
const { User, Expense } = require("../models");

const createUsersExpenses = async () => {
  const users = await User.findAll();
    for (const user of users) {
      const expenses = [...Array(10)].map((expense) => ({
        expense_name: faker.commerce.productName(),
        user_expense_id: user.id,
        amount: faker.commerce.price(),
        description: faker.commerce.productDescription(),
        category: faker.commerce.department(),
        date: faker.date.past(),
      }));
      await Expense.bulkCreate(expenses);
    }
};
module.exports = createUsersExpenses;

```

Code snippet of a data model using life-cycle hooks to control data validation and formatting:

```javascript
class Expense extends Model {}

Expense.init(
  {
    id: {
      type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
      allowNull: false,
      primaryKey: true,
      autoIncrement: true,
    },
    expense_name: {
      type: DataTypes.STRING,
      allowNull: false,
      validate: {
        len: [1, 255],
      },
    },
    user_expense_id: {
      type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
      references: {
        model: "user",
        key: "id",
      },
    },
    budget_id: {
      type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
      references: {
        model: "budget",
        key: "id", 
      },
    },
    amount: {
      type: DataTypes.DECIMAL(10, 2),
      allowNull: false,
      validate: {
        isNumeric: true,
      },
    },
    description: {
      type: DataTypes.STRING,
      allowNull: false,
      validate: {
        len: [0, 255],
      },
    },
    category: {
      type: DataTypes.STRING,
      allowNull: false,
      validate: {
        len: [1, 255],
      },
    },
    date: {
      type: DataTypes.DATE,
    },
  },
  {
    hooks: {
      async beforeCreate(newExpenseData) {
        if (newExpenseData.description === null) {
          newExpenseData.description = "No description provided.";
        }
        if (newExpenseData.description.length > 255) {
          newExpenseData.description = newExpenseData.description.substring(
            0,
            255
          );
        }
        if (newExpenseData.description.length < 1) {
          newExpenseData.description = "No description provided.";
        }
        if (newExpenseData.amount === null) {
          newExpenseData.amount = 0.0;
        }
        if (typeof newExpenseData.amount === "number") {
          newExpenseData.amount = parseFloat(newExpenseData.amount).toFixed(2);
        }
        return newExpenseData;
      },
    },
    sequelize,
    timestamps: false,
    freezeTableName: true,
    underscored: true,
    modelName: "expense",
  }
);
```

## Learning Points

Building MySQL Databases, Tables, Cookies and authentication handling. Alternatives to storing plain text passwords using databases. Front end / Back end integration using Restful routes. Creating and manipulating data using MySQL and Sequelize. Use of ORMs. And front-end / back-end integration.
